# Weakly Supervised Scene Text Detection using Deep Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains the setup for all experiments performed in our Paper ...
It is to be used in conjunction with the RL environment [text-localization-environment](https://github.com/emanuel-metzenthin/text-localization-environment), which is linked as a submodule.
